This is a front-end web application for a food delivery service, built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. It allows customers to order food and make requests online.

The key technical details are:

HTML and CSS are used to create the content, structure and styling of the pages. CSS animations and responsiveness provide an enhanced user experience.

JavaScript powers the dynamic functionality like tabs, modals, sliders, form validation etc. Modular architecture separates concerns into discrete modules.

External APIs are leveraged to fetch and render menu data on the page. Axios is used for API requests.

Webpack bundles the JS modules and assets into optimized static files. Babel transpiles ES6+ code to browser-compatible JS.

PHP provides a back-end for form submission handling. The front-end sends AJAX requests to PHP endpoints.

Local Storage caches data like cart information to persist across sessions.
The site is responsive across devices using flexbox, media queries and a mobile-first approach.

Animation effects and smooth scrolling aim to delight users.


This implementation showcases core front-end skills - creating reactive UIs, consuming remote data, modular JavaScript, CSS animations, responsive design etc. The workflow integrates modern tools like NPM, Webpack and Babel into the development process.
